# Sustainability-and-Climate-Change
The “Estimating Future Climate Change Impacts” project aims to evaluate future climate change effects by leveraging machine learning techniques applied to the CMIP6 dataset. The primary objective is to develop an AI model that analyzes the impacts of global warming and climate change using the annual surface temperature change dataset from CMIP6.
