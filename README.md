# Sustainability-and-Climate-Change

# Project Objective :
• The “Estimating Future Climate Change Impacts” project aims to evaluate future climate change effects by leveraging machine learning techniques applied to the CMIP6 dataset. The primary objective is to develop an AI model that analyzes the impacts of global warming and climate change using the annual surface temperature change dataset from CMIP6.

• CMIP6 is a global climate research initiative that compiles results from climate models developed by scientists worldwide. The CMIP6 dataset includes comprehensive information on greenhouse gas emissions, aerosols, and natural climate variations. It also covers key climate indicators such as global temperature changes, sea level variations, and precipitation patterns. This dataset contains environmental, economic, and social indicators related to global warming, helping to assess its potential consequences across different countries and regions. The dataset comprises multiple observations with both numerical and categorical independent variables. The target variable is the predicted temperature change.

# Key Research Questions:
  1.  Predicting Future Climate Trends

  • How can historical climate data from CMIP6 be used to forecast future climate changes?
  
  2.  Determine the impact of natural and human induced factors on climate

  • Compare the effects of these factors on climate to assess how they may contribute to future climate change.
